# Basic GUI w/ Python
Shane Kennedy

Programming Languages Used: Python

**** THIS CODE IS NOT COMPLETE ****

This code is to create a simple GUI with basic functionalities. The functionalities I decided to implement into this are a basic addition calculator, temperature converter, 
and unit converter. I created the GUI using Python's Tkinter extension and it proves to be quite useful.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~Current Problems~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CALCULATOR:
 - Currently only does addition
 - Output of equation is not present
 - It will add numbers to the input without the input of an operator
TEMPERATURE:
 - Currently not much added
 - Needs the unit dropdown selector (F, C, K)
 - Needs the input box
 - Needs the output display
UNIT CONVERTER:
 - Currently not much added
 - Needs the unit dropdown selector ("Foot", "Inch", "Mile", "Yard", "Kilometer", "Meter", "Centimeter", "Millimeter", "Micrometer", "Nanometer")
 - Needs the input box
 - Needs the output display

~REFLECTION~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The GUI library, Tkinter, is very similar in styling as JSwing in Java works. The GUI framework was easy to comprehend because I had previously worked with JSwing, and I was surprised
how easily they allowed for callback functions. I did get stuck on trying to output an array of integers as the equation. This solution has yet to be solved (and hopefully when I solve it, I will remember to delete this).
